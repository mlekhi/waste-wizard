Waste Wizard

Our game is a web application that utilizes react, we do not have an executable file for this reason and the user will have to download and install npm and flask.


- To download npm click the link and follow the instructions -> https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html
- Once download and you are in the client path, in the terminal run npm install and then npm start to boot up the web app
- To use the application you will also need to install flask, once you are in the server path, in the terminal run pip install flask


Description
- Waste Wizard is a garbage sorter game. There is a single player game mode that allows the user to drag different garbage objects into a bin to earn points which can be used to buy avatars and customized bins. There is also a multiplayer mode where two people can compete against each other using the keyboard to play. There is a shop feature that allows users to buy and equip avatars and garbage bins.


Navigation in the game
- There is a menu at the top of the page to allow users to naviagte to a specific page. There is a page for play, multiplayer, shop, tutorial, leaderboard, and login. If the user logs in with an instructor type account then debug and instructor dashboard show up on the menu as well.


- If your account drawn from the database is already a teacher account then you will have access to the debug and instructor mode otherwise they will not show up in the menu.


# Getting Started with Create React App


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run build`


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### `npm run eject`


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**


If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.


Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.


You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
